# Java's Coding Style

Important to further the goals set out in [SWE intro](https://github.com/Zypperman/xiandan/blob/7dbc432b390659de4fc5d14464078f827ef2502c/04%20CS%20Lore/Software%20Engineering%20Principles/SWE%20Intro.md). 

People need to be able to understand what you write once you're done with it.

Follow the [style guide here](https://nus-cs2030s.github.io/2021-s2/style.html) for Java specific practices, or use [Google's Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

ultimately, just use a checker to enforce this style policy, like [1](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/).
