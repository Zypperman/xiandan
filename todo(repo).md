- finish up readme, make it look like pytorch documentation
- formalize contributing guide
    - limited to 1 example that you need to build on for each topic, dont use analogies
    - state clearly assumptions, cite properly
- figure out template for content, likely just gonna use as little markdown as possible
    - possible formats: 
        - just raw markdown all the way
        - rst? cuz apparently its what pytorch uses also, will look into it later
        - jupyter notebooks, work and are the easiest to wrangle content
            - maybe have a toggle, so if people want to try coding out a solution they can just switch to it
            - potential challenge: switching between text and latex on markdown, lazy to do. obsidian can solve this i think
        - javascript for small coding envs? cuz if this then why not jupyter
    - visualisations, can handle with excalidraw, manim and whatever
- come up with a content organisation plan (yea i have no idea, gonna just dump what I have in my head for now)
    - obsidian knowledge graph format might work but prolly will scare off people
    - roadmap looks nice, but not sure how to format it, will deal with it later
    - V1 will just be me making a folder for what I think is necessary, then following DAP content structure
    - math primitives for like refresher up till jc i guess, stuff like probability, log, trigo and whatever, I have no idea, think about it later
    - discrete math
    - proofwriting
    - LA
        - Tensors, very impt like the semantic understanding not just doing dimensions with your numbers
    - stats
    - calc
    - linear reg and eval metrics
    - classification and eval metrics
    - ensemble techniques
    - basic NNs
    - Recsys
    - Time series 
    - Sequential data, RNNs, LSTMs
        - advanced time series for all the finbros
    - Transformer core (attention types etc)
    - Image transformer core
    - Generative AI Core
    - Transformer optimizations
        - introduce deepseek's model improvements ie multilatent attention
    - NNs for 3D applications (gaussian splatting, other models)
    - NNs for audio applications (classification and generation)
    - NNs for generation
    - Neurosymbolic AI
    - set one side for papers, indiv coverage + coverage where relevant
        - ie bandahau attention, att is all you need etc
    - Pytorch error logging and how to self help and troubleshoot
    - a few languages that are important for troubleshooting, so CUDA, YAML, C++, C and Java cuz sometimes that
    - Deployment
    - Quantum NNs (ansatz design, QAOA, QAE, Grover's alg. Shor's Alg)
- figure out how to translate 10th DAP content and address errors and mistakes made in slides
    - remove the fluff that isnt core content

- look into using https://www.transcrypt.org/ -- python compiler in js, but that prolly means revamping the entire page
