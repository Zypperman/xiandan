# Vim / NeoVim  

## Advice

Turn on the plugin for your current editor to use vim motions. I had an aneurysm dealing with LSP because I was a noob thrown into Neovim V0.11 when they revamped it.

## Configurations and distros

Look, set-up is brutal for newbies.You can learn it, but you'll waste 2 years getting everything perfect. You have 2 options (and i highly recommend the second one but will provide some starting points for both):

### Option 1: Making your own Config

Take the hard way out and literally learn everything there is to know about ricing something only you will ever see or even use, instead of doing something productive. Sure its a nice hobby to have, but spend your time wisely. Its a really deep rabbit hole.

#### Option 1 Resources

Frankly this changes constantly, this is CAA 2025. I recommend straight up searching on youtube, but this was what i found that helped me make my own config.

- [Primagen's (abit old) nvim config from scratch](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=fn4xuyoQHR0N6VKM)
    - Important because it externalizes your config folder.
        > [!caution] 
        > MAKE SURE YOU CONNECT YOUR GIT REPO TO THIS OR ELSE ALL YOUR RICING PROGRESS WONT BE SAVED IF YOUR COM DIES. Also commit it every now and the as you update.
    - good crash course until you hit LSPs, nvim now has its own LSP API. You might be here for a while deciding and downloading stuff.
        - [Josean Martinez's video does help with this alot actually](https://youtu.be/oBiBEx7L000?si=bpXKDdnxiOCT03ZT)
    - Also frankly use lazy.nvim, adapt the syntax once you realise that plugin managers are just git for plugins.

- [TJ DeVries, how to start with Vanilla Neovim](https://youtu.be/m8C0Cq9Uv9o?si=LDCw3vyDC7ZpHQOZ)
- [VS code to Neovim guide](https://youtu.be/7BqU7czXhSM?si=BI4NzrhQiJ9jcA3B)
    - like getting of crack to do fent.

### Option 2: Taking a Distro and working with it

Take the easier and better way out and just start with an nvim distro and learn edit its config to fit your needs from there.

#### Option 2 Resources

- [Elijah Manor's crash course lazyvim](https://youtu.be/N93cTbtLCIM?si=-mCWScCKCgowMMCo)
    - he's also the guy who teaches you how to switch between distros using NVIM_APPNAME and some shell script

- [Cursed comparison between Vim9script and Python](https://github.com/yegappan/Vim9ScriptForPythonDevelopers/blob/main/Vim9ScriptForPythonDevelopers.md)

## Raw Practice

- [Vimgenius](http://vimgenius.com/lessons/vim-intro/levels/level-1) for raw-dogging remembering commands

- after installing neovim, just try writing `nvim vimtutor` or after entering neovim, do `:Tutor`.
    - just remember not to save the file if you want to retry the exercises.
    - stopped at lesson 5.

- after that, you can try [vimtutor-sequel](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1eipuan/i_made_an_extended_version_of_vimtutor/).
