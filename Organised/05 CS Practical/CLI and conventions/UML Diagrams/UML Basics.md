### Class Diagram terminology

![UML Diagram terminology chart](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-diagram-domain-overview.png)

- Each big box is a class
    - Classes are types that we define for our model of the moving parts of our problem.
- Each line just shows a relationship between 2 classes
- numberings indicate the multiplicity of the relationship
    - multiplicity &#8212; x `<obj A>` can be related to y `<obj b>`
