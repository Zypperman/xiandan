# UML Diagrams and System Design

- For SWE dev transparency. Don't spend too long, this is a bottleneck.

- Do you even need UML?
    - ideally just for 3 things:
        - Sequence Diagrams
        - Class Diagrams
        - Use Case Diagrams
    - All to make sure everyone knows whats going on (for collaborating)
        - biz ppl will be able to express their ideas concretely
        - tech people will be able to explain to biz ppl what's going on and ask for pointers (ie if its user friendly).
