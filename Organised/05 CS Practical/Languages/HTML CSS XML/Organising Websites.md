# Organising websites

## Some guidelines

- your index page (`index.html`) should be located at the root of your project folder.
    - it should also be lowercase by browser convention.
- Each type of resource should have their own folder with fixed names (ie. `src`), with names:
    - `pages` &#8212; for pages other than your index page
    - `img` &#8212; for images
    - `css` &#8212; for css scripts
    - `js` &#8212; for javascript or typescript

- file and folder names should be short and lower-case because they need to be linked. KISS. Also:
    - don't use weird names
    - don't use spaces, use hyphens (because your URL will turn that space into `%20`, alongside other server-side problems)
