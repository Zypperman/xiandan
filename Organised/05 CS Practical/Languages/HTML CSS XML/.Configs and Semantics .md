# Semantics and Configs

## Making your first webpage

1. set up a project folder with git and github
2. make a file named `index.html` since browsers will look for that first.
3. Slap this boilerplate in:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
        <title>HTML 5 Boilerplate</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="index.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

### What each part of the boilerplate does

- `<Doctype>` &#8212; indicates the language specification that your browser should render your website in.
    - Without this, the browser will interpret the project using "quirks mode", which is how legacy code was interpreted before W3 conventions were made (and essentially, your content will be interpreted like one from a pre-html era).
    - Relevant documentation: [doctype tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) | [quirks mode and standard mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Quirks_mode_and_standards_mode)
- `<html>` &#8212; considered a root element since it is the top level element, outlines details about the rest of your content.
    - declare meta information like your the document's language. Technically you can also declare the version, but its implied from doctype so don't.
- `<meta>`, `<title>` and `<head>` &#8212; metadata about your website is stored in the header section
    - DO NOT PUT ANY DISPLAY CONTENT IN THE HEADER CONETENT
    - `<meta>` content just indicate metadata that your document has (ie the encoding method of your characters)
    - `<title>` content is just displayed in areas like your tab description in your browser.
        - without a tag, the tab's name would just be the name of the file.
- `<body>` &#8212; for the actual content of your website that users will see.

## Typical body elements

- `<p>` for paragraphs
- `<strong>` or `<b>` for bolding cotntent
    - `b` just adds bold fontface, `strong` indicates the text is significant
- `<em>` or `<i>` for italics, same relationship as `b` and `strong`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings
- `<!-- comments -->` for developer documentation

### list elements

- `<li>` to indicate a section for a list
- `<ul>` for unordered bullet lists
- `<ol>` for ordered numbered lists

## variety content elements

- `<a>` as an anchor tag to link objects 
    - use the `href ` attribute (set the destination link and clicking the element will bring you there)
    - use the `target` attribute to
