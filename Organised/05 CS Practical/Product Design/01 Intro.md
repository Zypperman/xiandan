# Product Management Mentality

## how to structure your Product (Grab example)

- by your target audience &#8212;
    - small pain points at a time ie.:
        - waiting for a taxi
        - availability (ie context of night periods and surcharges)
            - increased demand by matching people
        - transparency (where your guy is)
        - surge pricing

- payment patterns: why do they want deposits?
    - usually to help them expand
    - ie with street rental bikes, they have monthly plans
    - platform fee also needs to be captured via in-app purchases
        - basically they still need the money to host the platform and misc admin Features
    -also incorporate moment-based marketing and other concepts to enhance the app experience
        - ie the adspace should cater and be judged by the timing
        - the other tabs should be geared towards convenience

Know the difference between revenue and profit.

- revenue &#8212; cash coming into the biz
- profit &#8212; cash that you earn from your work.

The app doesn't need to profit, just needs to have revenue.
- the numbers need to check out, set every member's pay to 5k and see that you can have a way to have that amount to come in.
