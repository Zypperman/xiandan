> [!WARNING] MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO DRAW YOUR VALUE PROPOSITION CANVAS

- Good example is the iphone when it was released in 2007
    - era of change, tools were unified into a single platform
    - caused the most areas of change in a lot of industries
        - paper calendars now suck because you have a phone
        - television weather broadcasts are no longer valid because you have a phone
        - set up a lot of avenues
- PM encompasses 3 aspects:
    - biz &#8212; how to grow and profit
    - UX &#8212; how to make platform use smooth to retain
    - Technology &#8212; how to facilitate your use cases

#### Case study: Nokia

- lost relevance because they failed to adapt to other smart device OS systems
    - "thought they wre doing what was right, not what the market wanted"
    - Nokia stood well as a tool meant for engineers, ultimately did not retain the generic user base

#### Mission statement

- just important, represents some ambitious goal that your company is set on

### Being first to market != the best in the market

- tech innovates and always changes, usually in 2 years you'll see a fix
- ie view on AI, google translate, etc

### Branding with your product Name

- nice name, combine it with symbollism (ie fedex)
- so long as its memorable, and can bring value to the company
- symbollism for color is also important

### Identifying Pain Points
