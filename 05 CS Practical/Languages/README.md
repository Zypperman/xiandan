# Sources

- Mainly building on top of [learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/), I'll just copy paste in content and section by file name.

- Documentation will mainly revolve around niche language stuff ie. specific concepts and how behaviour changes because of it.
    - Contribute by adding random tips and tricks, theory content or ways of interpreting knowledge to help others.

- I'll also will just be dumping tips and tricks, esp for python, but for ML specific stuff like Pytorch, they'll obviously be in the ML folder.

## Other sources of quick documentation

- [Devdocs](https://devdocs.io/), but sometimes what they have might be outdated, taken from official docs or just incorrect.
