# Java Configs and Exposition

## Transitioning from solving small problems into the SWE mentality

write with the following in mind:

1. Maintainability (long term simple code v short term slipshot solution)
2. Scalability (solutions can be improved easily)
3. Transparency (with design patterns, implementations etc)

All have continuity in mind, which is important since ultimately humans are involved. Hence, on top of resource-efficiency, you need to consider how make your project easy for adoption and maintenance by other people.



## Favorable properties of Java

- Statically typed - declared vars can't change type
- OOP-friendly - good for SWE and flexibility
- Functional-programming suited - input and outputs are predictable

## SWE principles (broadly)

- 4 OOP principles:
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Abstraction
- SOLID
    - L - Liskov's Substitution principle
- Tell-Don't-Ask
- Composition over Inheritance
