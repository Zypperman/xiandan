# Java semantics and Configs

Refer to [Intro to SWE principles](https://github.com/Zypperman/xiandan/blob/main/04%20CS%20Lore/Software%20Engineering%20Principles/SWE%20Intro.md) for Java applications.

## Favorable properties of Java

- Statically typed - declared vars can't change type
- OOP-friendly - good for SWE and flexibility
- Functional-programming suited - input and outputs are predictable
