# Cloud Basics

Cloud is needed to:

- Leverage the connectivity of the internet
- Connect all sorts of <u>Terminal devices</u> (PC > Mobile devices > IOT)
- Facilitate infrastructure for handling data.

This has led to the creation of 2 new ideas:

1. The Internet of Everything (IOE), where all devices are interconnected through servers
2. Ecosystems, where

They're Not PCs, and it is also unix-like.
