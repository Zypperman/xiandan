# The Public Cloud (an overview)

## Core Features and elements

- Shared resource service (good to think wrt google colab)
- Cloud functionality is handled by 3P provider over the public internet
- Cloud functionality involves providing resources ie compute
- Pricing varies from free to pay per use
- No initial IT infrastructure is needed on the user's part
    - This reducees digital barriers and IT costs, good for start-ups

### Why Start Ups find Public cloud favorable

- Total Cost of ownership is low = operating model is more lightweight and costs are more manageable
- Company doesn't need to handle costs associated with maintaining their own server, hardware and infra since theyre not that big to need one yet
    - inital setup is expensive alongside managing various liability risks and maintenance complexity ie. fire safety, power etc
    - Not efficient to do privately
- more viable for development since its better for testing and verification, aligning with the objectives of Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD)
- public cloud is also more accessible
- security and privacy levels are also a lot higher than if they established a private cloud themselves
    - providers usually would have passed more security and privacy certifications.
- **Main benefit: Frees up Operations and Management of IT Infrastructure.**
