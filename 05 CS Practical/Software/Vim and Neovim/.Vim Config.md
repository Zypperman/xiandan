# Configuring Vim / NeoVim

<!-- using this opportunity to practice vim motions. -->

BY default, following the article, you can just use the `init.lua` as your configuration. I'll be using [Primagen's](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE?si=cyJ9sG9J18b_ZNCy), just for practicing.

## Neovim config file structure:

```txt.
.
└── C:/users/<user name>/AppData/Local/
    └── nvim/
        ├── init.lua
        ├── lua/
        │   └── config_profile/
        │       └── files_required_before_user
        └── any_prog_language/
            └── config_profile/
                └── files_required_before_user
```

Customization can be done for specific languages, so any time theyre run, scripts under the language dir will run and configure the files before you see it.

## Random pointers

- `init.lua` - initialization file, runs each time a new instance of neovim is created.
    - applies by requirements: Neovim main > language > Plugin.
  <!-- TODO: verify what exactly you refer to with Neovim engine -->
- if there some issue with your config or just anything in general with the folder in question, you run the line below in your CLI after replacing your filepath:

    ```PowerShell
    nvim --headless -c 'luafile C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\nvim\init.lua' -c 'echo "Loaded successfully"' -c 'qa'
    
    ```

    To check if you have any errors in the languages you've configured.
    - if the command runs successfully, you'll just see `"Loaded successfully"` in your terminal.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you are checking with the right editor. I wrote it in vim and checked whether it works in vim with `vim .` . Shoulda used `nvim .`.
