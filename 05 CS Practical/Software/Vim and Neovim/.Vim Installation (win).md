## Installing Vim

1. visit the homepage if you're lazy, and download their executable at  
   <https://www.vim.org/download.php>
2. while installing, once you reach the "Choose components" screen, change the type of install to 'Full'
3. Set your keyboard mappings to the new config, so no more ctrl+v for paste
4. Finish the installation
5. Open Powershell and enter `vim` to get in and start using.
