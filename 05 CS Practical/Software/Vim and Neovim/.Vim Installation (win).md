# Installing Vim and NeoVim for windows

Primagen has a VIM RC video i think, just use his configurations

<!--TODO: link primagen vids here for his vim and neovim configs-->

try [this guy](https://youtu.be/XBlKG2LW6p4?si=cox7gshrNGQw6fpN)

## Installing Vim

1. visit the homepage if you're lazy, and download their executable at  
   <https://www.vim.org/download.php>
2. while installing, once you reach the "Choose components" screen, change the type of install to 'Full'
3. Set your keyboard mappings to the new config, so no more ctrl+v for paste
4. Finish the installation
5. Open Powershell and enter `vim` to get in and start using.

## Installing NeoVim (referencing [this guy](https://blog.nikfp.com/how-to-install-and-set-up-neovim-on-windows#heading-get-a-cli-package-manager))

1. Get the latest version of powershell, not the one that comes with your PC
   - for the full guide, Refer to the official guide for [installing powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5).
   - preferrably just use a package manager like `winget` (should come standard with windows devices nowadays) or `Chocolatey`, for winget just open powershell in a terminal and do `winget search Microsoft.PowerShell`, you'll see (CAA 07-May-2025):

   ```Powershell
   Name               Id                           Version Source
   ---------------------------------------------------------------
   PowerShell         Microsoft.PowerShell         7.5.1.0 winget
   PowerShell Preview Microsoft.PowerShell.Preview 7.6.0.4 winget
   ```

   Just pick either version, then use their ID to complete this command:

   ```Powershell
   winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
   ```

   Replace `Microsoft.PowerShell` with `Microsoft.PowerShell.Preview` if you want the preview version.

2. Get a font for rendering glyphs cuz NeoVim sometimes uses special ones that normal fonts dont capture. Get from [nerdfont](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). I just use the default as per the article, CaskaydiaCove Nerd Font
   - extract then right click all and install.
   - then go to terminal > the down arrow next to the plus to create new windows > settings > defaults under the left sidebar > appearances > change font, and whatever else you want to change. I also changed my background here.

3. do `winget install neovim` on your terminal after restarting it as administrator.

## adding configs ([link for article section here](https://blog.nikfp.com/how-to-install-and-set-up-neovim-on-windows#heading-adding-your-first-configuration))

### 1. Installing plugins

- done with package manager, for winget (cuz im lazy) its:

   ```PowerShell
   winget install 'package name'
   ```

   for now, we just install ripgrep since its a prerequisite for Telescope.  

Popular plugins:

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) - a highly extendable fuzzy finder over lists.
- [Treesitter](https://neovim.io/doc/user/treesitter.html) - In-built parsers for understanding what language you using
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) - a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software.

### 2. Setting up where your vim runs from

TLDR, just read [this](https://blog.nikfp.com/how-to-install-and-set-up-neovim-on-windows#heading-adding-your-first-configuration) part of the article.
