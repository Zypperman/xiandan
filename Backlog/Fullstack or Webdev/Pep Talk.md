# What you're supposed to know as a fullstack (minimally)

We start from somewhere, so instead of describing what you should know to start, its better to describe what you definitely need to know when you're an accomplished million-stack dev:

## Frontend

A language to manipulate the User Interactions and User Experience (UIUX)

- HTML, CSS, and manipulating them with a frontend language
    - ie javascript, typescript, XML
    - Frameworks to facilitate more sophisticated workflows (react)
    - something to help you import and track that what you import is up to date (a package manager like node.js)
    - Software for accelerating development, by making coding environments easier to work with or more portable (either by making it easier to onbard other devs, or easier to work with)
        - stuff like docker which stuffs everything in a box that works, and Kubernetes (K8S) to manage these boxes
        - Github and Git for tracking and sharing your code

## Backend

A language to handle the logic that makes your app work

- most imperative programming languages ie C, C++, Python
    - for python, you also need a framework to be webapp friendly like flask
- Java / Kotlin
- Frameworks ie PHP's laravel and springboot (for SWE)
- A terminal environment for deployment
    - a linux distro

If you deal with user data, you need a way to secure and store data.

- you need a database and know how to interact with it (SQL)
    - languages can manipulate SQL since its just a string that you send to a database, and it returns you something
        - an appropriate database structure (relational, object oriented, graph, etc)
- cloud management for versioning everything (data, code) and making sure nothing collapses (cue cloud computing)

- SWE principles for writing ways for frontend users to use your service
    - ie API structures
- Content Management systems (CMS)
    - to make personalization even easier and smoother for users.

## Mindset

- be curious, to figure out exactly how things work
- know your field super well, and be detailed
- BE RELIABLE &#8212; underpromise and overperform
- present yourself and communicate well
- Be nice to work and collab with
- don't be tied down to only knowing 1 framework or language, pick stuff up quickly
- be super clean with your code, esp that every function doing one specific thing and is named well (separation of concerns, the S of SOLID principles in software engi)

## When to Self help, When to ask for help and How

Good questions have:

- Code snippets and good descriptions of their context
- are usually about the implementation, not the solution
    - ie "How do I complete Step 5 of the Rock Paper Scissors Assignment?" &#8212; bad
    - ie "Hey, I’m trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I’m getting a syntax error on line 12. How can I fix this? Here’s my code." &#8212; good
    - just read <https://xyproblem.info/>
    - Don't beat around the bush because [it has implications like gatekeeping and that you're lazy](https://dontasktoask.com/)
- dunno just refer back to [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-asking-for-help)

## Learning Guide

- remember to rest and take it slow, but not too slow.
    - Keep calm and pomdoro for a balance, and just let your brain cool off.
- Don't run down rabbit holes, it'll make sense when its supposed to make sense.
- Don't compare with others, just compare with yourself. Log down what you do everyday and dont regret it.
- Notes should either be:
    - links from sources that already explain it well, ie. documentation / articles
    - your own research but keep it super concise and easy to read.
        - not necessarily well formatted, just something people are comfortable with.
