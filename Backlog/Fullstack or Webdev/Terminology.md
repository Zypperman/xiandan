# Common Terminology in Webdev and Fullstack development

## Hardware related

Network switch
: A way to manage connections so you require fewer physical connections for your device to be connected to a network.

- instead of connecting n cables (n being the number of devices) to each device, just connect it to a central device that will manage connections between any 2 devices.

- Network : a set of connections between machines for communication.

- Router
: A computer that knows how to forward messages between networks.

- ISP (Internet service provider)
    - a company that manages some special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs' routers.

- Packets
: information that is broken down and is easier to transmit.

    - information is broken down into packets and travels through the network before coming out and being reassembled.

- IP Address
: how devices are distinguished over the network. You use this to note where to send information to, and where it was sent from.

- Clients and Servers
    - terms for the machines involved. the machine that users interact with is the client, the machine that faciliates hosting the website on the internet.

From MDN Docs:

- Web Server
: A computer that hosts a website on the Internet.

- Website
: A collection of web pages grouped together into a single resource, with links connecting them together.
    - also referred to as a "site".
    - webpages are just documents of html or other related resources that can be rendered by your web browser to show rich content.

- Web page
: A document that can be displayed in a web browser. These are also often called just "pages". Such documents are written in the HTML language (which we look at in more detail later on).

- Web service : A software that responds to requests over the Internet to perform a function or provide data.
    - Easiest to think this using the example of an API (Application programming interface) that we can send requests to, and get information.
        - However, APIs are a superset of web services. web services can only be hosted on IIS (nternet Information Services) but APIs can also be hosted in an app.
