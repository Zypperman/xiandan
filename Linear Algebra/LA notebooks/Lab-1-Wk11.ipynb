    "- The page rank of a website is determined from:\n",
    "    - The number of websites that link to it\n",
    "    - The significance (page rank) of the websites that link to it\n",
    "- We use an __adjacency matrix__, $R$ to denote the links among websites\n",
    "    - Rows denote the outward links    \n",
    "    - Columns denote inward links\n",
    "    - The inward links are also called its backlinks\n",
    "- We will then define a __link matrix__, $L$ \n",
    "    - Columns denote the outward links    \n",
    "    - Rows denote inward links\n",
    "    - *Note that this is reversed with respect to the Adjacency matrix $R$*\n",
    "    - We will normalize each column to one\n",
    "    - This means a random surfer on one website has equal probability of ending up on any of the site that it links to.\n",
    "- Take a look at the example shown below:  \n",
    "<img src=\"Lab1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" >  \n",
    "- To get the page rank of a website __A__, we need to know which of the websites  link to it (in our case - **B, C, D, E**)\n",
    "- We will use vector $r$, to store the page ranks of *all* web pages.\n",
    "- Page Rank of __A__ is the sum of page ranks of all the websites linking to it, weighted by specific link probability taken from link matrix, $L$.\n",
    "    - Clearly, this problem is self-referential\n",
    "    - We can write it as $r = Lr$\n",
    "    - We are, therefore, looking for an eigen vector of $L$ with an eigenvalue 1\n",
    "- In our case, the link matrix $L$ is a $5\\times5$ matrix and we can solve it exactly\n",
    "- In real life though, the link matrix is huge (say couple of billion rows and columns), and we need only one eigenvector\n",
    "    - Our best strategy, therefore, is to solve it iteratively\n",
    "    - We start by assuming page ranks of all websites to be same   \n",
    "    - $r = [1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5, 1/5]$\n",
    "    - We will then say, $r_{i+1} = L* r_{i}$ and iterate until $r$ stops changing\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will build the __Link matrix__, $L$ in two steps:\n",
    "    - Let's make the __Adjacency Matrix__, $R$ to denote the links among websites\n",
    "    - We can then build the __Link matrix__, $L$ from $R^T$ by normalizing each column by total number of outward links"
