    "## Theory\n",
    "Perspective correction asks the question what an image would look like, from a different camera angle. This is a basic idea in computer vision, and used extensively in video games, CG animation, special effects etc. This lab goes through the theory behind it, using an example. Work on it as a group, if possible.\n",

We will have to use the concept of [homogenous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates), which allows us to use matrix multiplications for some non-linear transformations as well.
