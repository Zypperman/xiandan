 Xian Dan Pill is a personal wiki of all the knowledge that I've acquired about ML and CS, structured as a repository of bite-sized content. I'll be using this to both learn and validate what I know about ML. Raise errors where necessary. This will also be then reformed into a wiki for DAP.

## Motivation

DAP (Data Associates Program) is an academic program run by SMU BIA (Business Intelligence and Analytics club). After being in it as both a mentee and a mentor, I've realised that its sometimes difficult, even as a mentor, to assert whether whatever we're teaching is correct (as per the usual flaws of self-guided learning, you won't know you're wrong until someone corrects you). A friend has also constantly reminded me of this, alongside how I should formally document my knowledge somewhere that people can not only keep me accountable in terms of progress, but also check in and make sure that the content I'm teaching others is valid and correct. I'm planning to set this up for students to refer to this, and contribute where necessary if there is lacking content or specific interpretations that make of a concept more intuitive. This is also my roundabout way of possibly teaching students how to use source control software.

## Objectives

- To teach ML:
    - in a no-nonsense format
    - to a rigorous degree
    - as fast as possible
- To teach any ancillary topics that might be needed (ie. what caching is, so for that its good to go into Computer Organisation and operating systems. We will just provide for it, but obviously if its not necessary you don't need to look for it.)
    - computer organisation and OS 
    - SWE design patterns so its easier to collaborate
    - source control

## Contribution guide

- I'll cook up some standards, but they ultimately serve the objective of teaching the average joe as fast as possible.
- use as few examples as needed
- cite sources under each folder's `sources.md` file. Cite at the bottom if possible.

## Dedications

- All members and organisers of the 9th and 10th DAP rounds.
- My mentor Nicole, who taught me not to keep my face towel in the bathroom.

## Current progress

- Math
    - LA (Current)
    - Discrete Math (Next)
- CS Practical
    - languages
        - Java (Current)
        - C (Next)
    - Software
        - AWS (Current)
        - Git and Github (Next)


## Future extensions

- formalize contribution guide
- other programming languages
- other cs theory
- other topics in my degree like law, but I'll need to check the viability of this
