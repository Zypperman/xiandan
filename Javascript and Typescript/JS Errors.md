# JS errors

- Reference Error &#8212; undefined variable used within current scope
    - ie you use a variable called `person` but its not defined to be anything
- Syntax Error &#8212; code cannot be parsed properly because you forgot a semicolon or some syntax thing
    - commonly seen in beginners when they declare multiple variables in 1 line
- Type Error &#8212; when you invoke methods that aren't defined for a type (ie using an array method for a string)
