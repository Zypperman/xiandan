Honestly, I found Javascript to be quite a bad idea of a language with the kind of things it allowed. This was best illustrated with typescript's abstract using snippets like:

```js
if ("" == 0) {
    // fulfills equality, but has no sense in doing so
}
if (1 < x < 3) {
  // True for *any* value of x, in any case bruh why
}
```

Obviously to fix this, we have the strict equality term `===` for the first problem, but frankly the second problem theres no real fix. 

Typescript makes the language a lot more QOL things are present for devs.


## Javascript

- [MDNdocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
    - more than JS, it also has extensive docs for everything related to webdev, but reads like a dictionary.

- 30 days of Javascript
    - I some scuffed reference notes for it for the key things they cover, but its just best to browse through. Exercises are not mandatory, just work on a project.
- Odin project
- [Javascript, The good parts (Douglas Crockford)](https://andersonguelphjs.github.io/OReilly_JavaScript_The_Good_Parts_May_2008.pdf)
    - Good as an instruction manual, if learnxinyminutes is too vague.
    - Teaches OOP etc really quickly, but only handles very general things, not stuff you'd typically encounter like promises, asynchronous functions, etc.

## TypeScript

- [Typescript official docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
    - ngl it doesn't get any better from here.
    - [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html) &#8212; ideal for a full beginner rundown
